## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
## Module 4 Challenge 1
#First, create a vector of 1, word character strings comprising the first line of the novel Ulysses, by James Joyce: “Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.”
#Then, extract every third element of this vector.

Ulysses <- c("Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.")
Ulysses
c <- str_split(Ulysses," ", simplify = TRUE)
c
f <- c[seq(from = 3, to = 22, by = 3)]
f

```
```{r}
## Module 4 Challenge 2
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
#Given the matrix, m, above, extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
x <- m[, c(2,3,6)]
x
#Given the matrix, m, above, extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable x
r <- c(6,7,8)
x <- m[r, , drop = FALSE]
x
#Given the matrix, m, above, extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable x
r <- c(2)
x <- m[, c(2:6, 9)][r, , drop = FALSE]
x
#or?
x <- m[2, c(2:6, 9)]
x
```
```{r}
## Module 4 Challenge 3 
#Construct a 4-dimensional, 400 element array (5 x 5 x 4 x 4) named a consisting of the numbers 400 to 1 (i.e., a descending series)
a <- array(400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Module 3: Step 4 error "remote origin already exists."
- Go to terminal and enter: git remote remove origin
- To check that handler is deleted properly, run the following: git remote -v
- Enter the desired origin from code in github
Module 4 Challenge 1 TIP: 
- Str_split will take a string and divide it into substrings but make sure that simplify is TRUE or else it may not work
